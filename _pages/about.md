<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology at the *School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang Normal University*, under the supervision of [**Prof. Jia Zhu**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KO3MIkQAAAAJ&hl=en) in the *Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Intelligent Education Technology and Application*. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from the *College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou University*.

My research interests focus on **Large Language Models**, with a particular emphasis on **Retrieval Augmented Generation**, **Reasoning Capabilities**, **Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models**, and **Applications in Scientific Domains**.
